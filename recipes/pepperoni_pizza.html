    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This pepperoni pizza recipe produces a quick and easy classic! Delicious homemade pizza crust and tomato sauce have never been easier!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Homemade pizza dough</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup mozzarella cheese shredded</li>
        <li>2 ounces pepperoni slices</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cornmeal (optional)</li>
        <li>flour for dusting when stretching dough</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Oil a baking sheet or add a handful of cornmeal to the pan per the instructions for the pizza dough. If the dough was in the refrigerator set it on the counter or in a warm place before stretching it so it comes to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Gently stretch and knead the dough on a clean and dry floured surface. Add a sprinkle of flour as you stretch the dough if the dough becomes sticky. Add flour to the rolling pin and roll the pizza dough until it is twelve inches across.</li>
        <li>Transfer the dough to the baking pan, round pizza pan or use a pizza peel to transfer it to a hot pizza stone in the oven.</li>
        <li>Add tomato sauce, cheese and pepperoni.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza for 10-12 minutes. The crust will be fluffy on the inside but golden brown on the outside when it has finished cooking. Remove from oven, slice and enjoy! Top with parmesan cheese or even red pepper flakes to give it a spicy kick!</li>
    </ol>
